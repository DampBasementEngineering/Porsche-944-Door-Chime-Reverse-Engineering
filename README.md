# Porsche-944-Door-Chime-Reverse-Engineering
A 1:1 copy of Porsche part number 928 618 102 01, which is the relay that emits a chime what a door is ajar or a seatbelt is unfastened.
This is a 100% analog circuit board that replicates the original design by Porsche but with modern surface mount components to reduce size and hypothetical production costs.
As of July 18th, 2024, this is a work in progress and the physical product remains untested.
